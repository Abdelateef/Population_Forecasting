# Population_Forecasting
This repository contains a numerical analysis program that focuses on modeling and analyzing population growth patterns in Egypt using curve-fitting techniques. The goal of the project is to forecast future population trends based on historical data.

## Introduction

The project "Population Growth Models" aims to develop a program that uses curve-fitting methods to analyze and predict population growth trends in Egypt. The program processes historical population data and fits different curve models to find the best-fitting one. This allows for predicting future population dynamics, growth rates, and inflection points.

## Methodology

The program uses three main curve fitting techniques: linear regression, quadratic curve fitting, and exponential curve fitting. Historical population data from 1999 to 2020 is used for analysis. The program calculates coefficients for each model and evaluates the accuracy of predictions.

## Results

The program generates graphs comparing the fitted curves with the actual population data. The accuracy of each model is measured using the least-squares error. The quadratic model proves to be the most accurate among the three methods.

## Conclusion

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of using curve-fitting techniques to forecast population trends. The quadratic model offers the most accurate predictions for Egypt's population growth.

Feel free to contribute to this project by suggesting improvements, optimizations, or additional curve-fitting techniques.
